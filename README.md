# Devathon-2020
This project is about automating the process of keeping record of Extras taken by the students in MESS and generating bill at the end of every month.
The student will be provided a unique QRCODE which he/she have to scan at their particular mess and also he will select the items and their quantities they have to consume 
in their breakfast/lunch/dinner/evening snacks, and that amount will be added to their account and at the same time an sms will be received by student which 
states the extra items they chose , they will show that to the counter and receive the food. At the month ends the bill will be generated and sent to students.
